Blockchain Security Controls
=====================================
The BSC (Blockchain Security Controls) prescribes security controls for blockchain implementations.

Blockchain technology has earned the trust of Governments and banks around the world. 

There is an urgent need for an accepted security controls for secure blockchain implementations.  The BSC is a constantly evolving project that prescribes security controls for blockchain implementations. Many of the security controls are based on NIST Special Publication 800-53 Revision 5 and may also apply to distributed ledger systems.
